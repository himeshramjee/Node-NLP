        This spike was built using a random tutorial I found. You'll find it <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/sentiment-analysis-node-js/">here.</a>
        <br/>
        It uses the <a href="https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural">Natural Node</a> NodeJS module to perform the sentiment analysis.
        For each request, as you type, the module returns values between -1 and 1 that are roughly mapped to displayed sad, neutral and happy emoticons.
        I thought this was really cool and it is but the results aren't as decent as I expected. But it served my purpose of building my first simple NodeJS webpage. :)
