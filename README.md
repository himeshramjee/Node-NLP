Sandbox environment to explore NodeJS and sentiment analysis via a Natural Language Processing module.

# Sentiment Analysis with *Natural* NodeJS package

## Anything interesting here?
Yes! This was my first tutorial around using NodeJS and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Tech used to build this website
1. IntelliJ IDE
1. Git
1. Docker
1. NodeJS
1. Nginx (not required for this project)

# Where do you host this website?
Curently hosted on AWS Lightsail. I've added an Nginx web proxy layer as I think I'm going to use the same instance for exploring a couple other things.
   * Why? 'cos I wanted to see what Lightsail is about and do a quick refresher on using Nginx.
   * AWS Ligthsail is also nice for really simple websites like this. It however doesn't integrate well with my custom domain setup.
     It's great as a all-in-one self contained solution though. Pitty I couldn't get it to play nice with my on-a-tight-budget custom domain setup.

# What else are you working on?
I've started listing personal projects on this website (more of a TODO list for me). Take a look at https://himesh.ramjee.co.za.
